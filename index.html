          <li> <strong><i>2001</i></strong> - he started to step up the distance and won the IAAF half marathon. He also established the Ethiopian Great Run in 2001,

          <li> <strong><i>2010</i></strong> - he announced retirement after dropping out of the New York City Marathon with an inflamed knee. However,

        <blockquote>
          Haile Gebrselassie is the best distance runner I have seen in the last quarter-century, the most electrifying personality, and somewhat of an enigma, given his Ethiopian roots. With this wonderful book, Jim Denison allows the whole world to learn more about Haile The Great, a distance-running star whose brilliance won’t soon be forgotten.”
          <cite> --Amby Burfoot, executive editor, Runner’s World, and 1968 Boston Marathon winner</cite>
